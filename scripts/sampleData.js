We seek to create an online meetup group to bring fathers together in person. We'll meet several times a month, with our kids, at parks, playgrounds, museums, parent-and-me classes, and living rooms across the Atlanta Metro area. We'll also organize parenting workshops and dads-nights-out to give our members an opportunity to socialize, learn, and support each other as we navigate parenthood. There are not enough resources, social groups, or services for dads. This is a destination for active dads! A diverse group with dads of all stripes: Stay At Home Dads, Dads with flexible schedules, work from home dads, freelance dads, working dads, and involved fathers in and around the Atlanta area to socialize and interact with other guys who enjoy spending quality time with their children.</p>\n<p>The Atlanta Dads Group is a hub of our national organization - <a href=\"http://citydadsgroup.com/\">City Dads Group</a>. City Dads Group has communities of dads in other major metropolitan cities such as NYC, Boston, Philly, L.A., San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and Columbus.</p>\n<p>** Please note this group is strictly for Dads with kids. We want this group to be a comfortable place for Dads to learn and talk about anything parent related.</p>\n<p>Social Media.

We will arrange/select the route and pairing at the facility.</p> <p>Note- There will be a need to have 5 people help out in the kitchen with preparing and assistance with loading the vehicles. Let us know by private message or email if you are interested ([masked])</p> <p>Everyone will need to complete a waiver liability form upon arrival. Please bring a printed copy your driver’s license and proof of insurance as well.</p> <p>Thanks we look forward to seeing you in November!</p> <p>JUST IN!!! ----Help our Hungry Seniors. Bring some Canned Goods.<br/>As a stop-gap for seniors in immediate need, we have an Emergency Pantry for those who are on our waiting list for home-delivered meals. As a result, we rely on donations of canned goods to stock the shelves of the pantry. It'd be awesome if volunteers can bring canned goods with them on the day of your volunteer shift to help our seniors in need!</p>",
