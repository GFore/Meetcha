We seek to create an online meetup group to bring fathers together in person. We'll meet several times a month, with our kids, at parks, playgrounds, museums, parent-and-me classes, and living rooms across the Atlanta Metro area. We'll also organize parenting workshops and dads-nights-out to give our members an opportunity to socialize, learn, and support each other as we navigate parenthood. There are not enough resources, social groups, or services for dads. This is a destination for active dads! A diverse group with dads of all stripes: Stay At Home Dads, Dads with flexible schedules, work from home dads, freelance dads, working dads, and involved fathers in and around the Atlanta area to socialize and interact with other guys who enjoy spending quality time with their children.</p>\n<p>The Atlanta Dads Group is a hub of our national organization - <a href=\"http://citydadsgroup.com/\">City Dads Group</a>. City Dads Group has communities of dads in other major metropolitan cities such as NYC, Boston, Philly, L.A., San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and Columbus.</p>\n<p>** Please note this group is strictly for Dads with kids. We want this group to be a comfortable place for Dads to learn and talk about anything parent related.</p>\n<p>Social Media.
