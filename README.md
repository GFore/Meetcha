# Meetcha!

## Overview: 

Meetcha! is a responsive webApp that allows you to bypass Meetup's machine learning algorithm to populate what meetups you'd like to be apart of. Meetcha allows you to put in the zipcode of where ever you are or will be and it will give you a list of meetups in a given radius, of which you also get to choose. 

### Features: 

- Grabs initial current location
- Centers on given zipcode and provides a dynamic list that changes for every search
- Google markers allow you to click on the location and be given the title, date, and meetup URL
- Accordian style list to scroll through if the google map markers don't give you the information you're looking for

## Tools and Technologies

**Languages:**
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

**API's**
- Google Maps JavaScript API for mapping meetup events
- Meetup API for a list of all events

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
- Initially center a map on a predetermined location
- Given a zipcode and radius provide a list of events
- Have those events pinned to the map
- When pins/markers are clicked have a dynamic div that populates with the events information
- Ability to reset search or resubmit a new search that clears the current one
- Responsive at different sizes

**Stretch Goals**
- Have pins/markers animate when hovering over the event in the list
- Make the list into an accordion
- Ability to search by more than just zipcode
- Stop pins/markers from stacking when at the same position
